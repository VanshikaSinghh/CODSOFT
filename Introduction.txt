While deeding some sweat in CODSOFT I had the chance to work on a number of creative solutions which show my technical skills with concluding logic ability. Every project was purpose-built to solve a real-world problem, using state of the art technology and methodologies.

In all these projects, my main focus was to design impactful solutions that can scale and be optimally efficient, still in line with the CODSOFT mission – To advance technology and Innovations. These projects showcase my ability to mix creativity with technical proficiency—from designing solid algorithms, to developing user-friendly interfaces.
